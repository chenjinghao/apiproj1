How might we simplify the financial management process (budgeting, investments, insurance) for fresh graduates and early investors?

### Team made up of:
Product Manager: Jeremy

Scrum Master: Nicole

Business Analyst: Maggie

### Tools for technical development:
Glitch, VSC, API, Heroku, Postman, Netlify, Google Cloud Platform, mySQL

### Methods and Processes
Applied Scrum on Agile Project Management. Design Thinking

Conduct Planning Meeting, Daily standups, bi-monthly Retrospectives, MVP delivery.

A static prototype was developed on powerpoint to put concepts onto the drawing board. It allows team to slice and dice the conceptual model to test the robustness of model, and allow team to ask questions and clarify doubts.

Team is split into frontend and backend coders writing small sections of the app independently.

Over a few days of intensive coding, the team regroups daily to piece the parts together.

Cumbersome codes were re-written to streamline, or modified to make parts work independently and successfully first before layering in more features and complexity when joined. Frontend codes were tested first while the team is still learning to deploy the database to the backend.

We also had to ensure the Auth0 authentication could work with our codes.

### Initial POC:
