### Project Business Problem:
How might we simplify the financial management process (budgeting, investments, insurance) for fresh graduates and early investors?

### Team made up of:
Product Manager: Jeremy

Scrum Master: Nicole

Business Analyst: Maggie

Coders: Adam, Beatrice, Justin, Nithin

### Tools for technical development:
Glitch, VSC, Heroku, Postman, Google Cloud Platform, my SQL

### Tools used for Cloud based Collaboration:
Mural, MS Teams for meetings, Miro Kudo Wall, Git, Github

### Method:
Applied Scrum on Agile Project Management.

Conduct Planning Meeting, Daily standups, bi-monthly Retrospectives, MVP delivery.

A static prototype was developed on powerpoint to allow coders to ask questions and clarify doubts.

Team is split into frontend and backend coders writing small sections of the app independently.

Over a few days of intensive coding, the team regroups daily to piece the parts together.

Cumbersome codes were re-written to streamline, or modified to make parts work. Frontend codes were tested first while the team is still learning to deploy the database to the backend.

We also had to ensure the Auth0 authentication could work with our codes.

### Initial POC:
apiproj1 interim testing collaboratively
